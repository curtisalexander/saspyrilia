Setting up code sandboxes using Docker.

<!--truncate-->

To build a set of code sandboxes for use with this site, I decided to build and run a [Docker image](https://github.com/curtisalexander/saspyrilia-sandbox/packages/472186/versions) that starts up a Jupyter Lab environment with kernels for the languages SAS, Python, R, and Julia.  Thus all code examples are created and developed in the notebook format.  The advantage of running a Jupyter Lab environment is that I can launch a single application and have all languages available to me to toggle among.

A detailed description for building and running the sandboxes can be found in the [README](https://github.com/curtisalexander/saspyrilia-sandbox/blob/main/README.md) of the [saspyrilia-sandbox repo](https://github.com/curtisalexander/saspyrilia-sandbox).
