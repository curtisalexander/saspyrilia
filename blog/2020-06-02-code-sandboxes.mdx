Setting up code sandboxes.

<!--truncate-->

:::info
Alternative instructions using Docker may be found [here](codesandboxes-docker).
:::

In order to build and test out the code on this page, I have setup code sandboxes for each of the major languages detailed on the site: SAS, Python, R, and Julia.  The details below are how I setup these sandboxes on a Mac.  Setup on Windows or Linux would differ only slightly.

In addition to the documentation below, the [saspyrilia-sandboxes](https://github.com/curtisalexander/saspyrilia-sandboxes) repository contains many of the actual code examples tested before being moved over to this site.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

    let langs = ['sas', 'py', 'r', 'julia'];
    return(langs[Math.floor(Math.random()*langs.length)]);
  })()}

Follow the instructions provided by SAS.

https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition/download-software.html

In summary:
- Downloading and installing [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Downloading the SAS University Edition image (requires a SAS login)
- Import the just downloaded image into VirtualBox
- Configure the `myfolders` directory
    - The documentation at the site above notes the need to create a `SASUniversityEdition` directory; this is not actually needed.  In fact the `myfolders` directory is not needed either.  But to persist code / data on the filesystem, the expectation is that a `myfolders` directory is used.  For more details see the [FAQ](https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/shared_folder_whatis.htm).
- Start up the software from within VirtualBox

<!-- ### SAS Troubleshooting
To get my network adapter working appropriately within VirtualBox, I had to follow the instructions below.

https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/trouble_VPN.htm

I had to navigate to `~/VirtualBox VMs/SAS University Edition` and then submit the following command.
```
VBoxManage modifyvm "SAS University Edition" --natdnshostresolver1 on
```
-->

### VirtualBox Troubleshooting
I had an issue with VirtualBox on macOS where I received the following error &mdash; `Kernel driver not installed`.  The page below helped to fix.

See the below for details on [managing conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

### Init
Ensure your shell is configured for working with `conda`.
```
conda init <shellname>
```

Use a specific location for an environment
```
conda create --prefix ./envs
```

Create an `environment.yml` file.  First ensure you have [activated](#activate) your environment.
```
conda env export > environment.yml
```

Now edit the `environment.yml` file to utilize relative directory paths instead of absolute paths.  Give the environment an appropriate name &mdash; for this example, I named my environment `sandbox`.

Make sure to add the `envs` directory to your `.gitignore` file.

### Activate
Activate your environment
```
conda activate ./envs
```

### Add and Remove Dependencies
Again, ensure you have [activated](#activate) your environment.

Edit the `environment.yml` file by adding needed dependencies.  Dependencies can be added simply with the package required.  For a more complex setup package versions may be included.  Add dependencies under the `dependencies` key in the yaml file.

Run the following to build the environment based on your `environment.yml` file.  Note that with the `--prune` option, packages not listed will be removed.
```
conda env update --prefix ./envs --file environment.yml --prune
```

### Identical Environment
Export the environment, with detailed versioning information, to an explicit specification file.  As the conda documentation notes, an explicit specification file is not cross platform.

```
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```

Building an environment for R involves utilization of [renv](https://github.com/rstudio/renv).

### Install `renv`
Install `renv` to your global set of packages.  This is the only new package installed to the global location.
```R
install.packages("renv")
```

To see where your libraries live on disk, run `.libPaths()` from within R.

### RStudio Project
Setup directory as an [RStudio Project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

### `renv` workflow
A simple outline to the `renv` workflow can be found within the library's [documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/).

In summary:
- Initalize via `renv::init()`
- Install packages using either `renv::install() or install.packages()`
- Snapshot packages via `renv::snapshot()`
- Repeat

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="julia">

The general workflow utilizes [Revise.jl](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/).  This workflow is outlined in two key places:
- [Revise documentation](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/cookbook/)
- [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/workflow-tips/#Revise-based-workflows-1)

### Add [Revise.jl](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/)
Initial setup requires adding `Revise.jl`.  For ease, add to the global environment.

```
pkg> add Revise
```

Then setup `Revise` to launch at startup.  Edit `.julia/config/startup.jl` to use `Revise`.  Note that at the time of writing I am using Julia `1.4.x`.

```julia
# Julia 1.5+ and Revise 2.6+
# try
#     using Revise
# catch e
#     @warn(e.msg)
# end

# Earlier versions of Revise and/or Julia
atreplinit() do repl
    try
        @eval using Revise
        @async Revise.wait_steal_repl_backend()
    catch e
        @warn(e.msg)
    end
end
```

### Initial Package Setup
The below only is needed for creating the initial package.

#### Generate Package
Per the instruction for a [throw away project](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/workflow-tips/#Revise-based-workflows-1) generate a new package using `Pkg`.

First, `cd` into the appropriate directory.  Then startup a Julia REPL. From the Julia REPL enter into the `Pkg` REPL using `]`.  Your prompt will change to `pkg>`.

Now generate the actual package.

```
pkg> generate MyPkg
```

Exiting requires `Ctrl+C` or using `Backspace`.

#### Use Package
Now use the actual package and test that it was setup appropriately.

```julia
using MyPkg
MyPkg.greet()
```

### Work with Dependencies
If need to add or remove packages, utilize the flow below.

#### `activate` Package
`cd` into the package directory (the directory containing the `Project.toml` file).

Start a Julia REPL and then `activate` the package.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
```

#### Add / Remove packages
Now drop into the `Pkg` REPL using `]` and add or remove any packages needed.

```
pkg> add DataFrames
pkg> update; precompile
```

### Workflow
The below is a general workflow assuming no further packages need to be added.

#### `activate` package
Start a Julia REPL and then `activate` the package.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("MyPkg")
```

#### Edit Source Code
Finally, you are ready to edit source files!  `cd` into the new package directory.

```bash
cd /some/path/MyPkg
```

Edit the file `src/MyPkg.jl`.  This file is being tracked by `Revise` and thus it can serve as a file runner where it points to other source files.

For example, within the file `src/MyPkg.jl` reference another source file.

```julia
module MyPkg
include("Tmp.jl")

end
```

#### Test Source Code
Again, referencing the [Revise cookbook](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/cookbook/), enter the below to use the package.

```julia
using MyPkg
```

Finally, utilize your REPL to validate the changes!

```julia
MyPkg.SomeOtherModule.func()
```

To force a refresh, use the following.

```julia
revise(MyPkg)
```

<!--## Setup `PkgTemplates`
Using the [Package-centric workflow](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/cookbook/#Package-centric-usage-1) notes the need to setup [PkgTemplates](https://invenia.github.io/PkgTemplates.jl/stable/).

First, ensure `PkgTemplates` has been added as a package.

From the Julia REPL enter into the `pkg` REPL using `]`.  Your prompt will change to `pkg>`.

```
pkg> add PkgTemplates
pkg> update; precompile
```

Exiting requires `Ctrl+C` or using `Backspace`.

## Setup development package with `PkgTemplates`
Now follow the [Revise documentation](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/cookbook/) for utilizing `PkgTemplates`.

```
using PkgTemplates
t = Template()
t("MyPkg")  # in lieu of generate("MyPkg", t)
```

Note that for this work, I had to add the following to my `.gitconfig` file.

```
[github]
    user = myusername
```

Thus my new development package is now stored at `~/.julia/dev/MyPkg`.  The `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` files are contained within.

### Artifacts
Although I have not used the functionality, it looks to be quite interesting.
