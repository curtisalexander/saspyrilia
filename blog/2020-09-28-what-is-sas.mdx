What is SAS or why is **fill-in-the-blank** feature so odd?

<!--truncate-->

SAS is not a language, per se, but a set of languages or even [DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) all wrapped up into a single system.  

Some of those languages include:
- [SAS datastep](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lestmtsref&docsetTarget=n1kh25to5o0wmvn1o4n4hsl3yyww.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en)
- [SAS ds2](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=proc&docsetTarget=p05tdglkbczcp1n1ijbhzakb1cet.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en)
- [SAS macro language](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=mcrolref&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en)
- [Lua embedded within SAS](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=proc&docsetTarget=n1csk38ocks0rgn1rr8d302ofqgs.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en)
- [SAS CAS actions and CASL](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=pgmdiff&docsetTarget=p06ibhzb2bklaon1a86ili3wpil9.htm&docsetVersion=3.4&locale=en)

The same is true for Python &mdash; [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) or [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) can be thought of as DSLs.  In the R ecosystem, [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) or [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) are referred to as a grammar of data manipulation and a grammar of graphics respectively.  Finally, [David Sanders notes](https://julialang.org/blog/2017/08/dsl/) that the Julia [macro system](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/) enables the creation of domain specific languages.

As machine learning pipleines become more sophisticated they will evolve to become more like actual programming languages.  The idea is not original to me but was noted by the [Julia community](https://julialang.org/blog/2017/12/ml-pl/) back in 2017.

Oftentimes as analysts approach new languages, or even aspects of their language of choice, they will encounter odd syntax or different ways required to approach their code.  If the analyst only has ever encountered a single language or ecosystem then these oddities may be jarring.  But as they gain in experience in that language, or gain experience using multiple languages, they will hopefully approach these oddities as an opportunity to build their knowledge!  Or better yet, they may view the challenge as an opportunity to learn yet another, new language.
