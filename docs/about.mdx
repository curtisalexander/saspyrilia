### Why saspyrilia?
`saspyrilia` = SAS + Python + R + Julia

### What else is planned?
Languages and tools that are *planned* to be featured for working with data:
- command line tools
    - [`awk` and `sed`](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sedawk.html)
- shells
    - [bash](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) and [POSIX](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html) shells

    - [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7)
- SQL variants
    - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
